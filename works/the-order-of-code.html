                <h3>Thesis</h3>
                <p>This is Moocoo's most powerful, forward-looking work. He argues that the resistance to AI is a reactionary effort to preserve the episteme of the Modern Age, which placed "Man" at the center of all knowledge. He defends the emerging "<a href="/lexicon.html#computational-episteme">Computational Episteme</a>" not as a tragedy, but as a necessary and liberating de-centering of the human. For Moocoo, the "erasure of Man" is not something to be feared, but a welcome release from a historically brief and violent form of humanism.</p>

                <h3>Core Analytical Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The identification of the emerging **Computational Episteme**, an order of knowledge founded on code and data rather than "Man."</li>
                    <li>The concept of **The Laughter of the Datacenter** as the limit-experience that reveals the contingency and fragility of humanist thought.</li>
                    <li>The provocative and liberating thesis of the **Erasure of "Man"** as the welcome end to a violent and historically brief configuration of knowledge.</li>
                </ul>

                    </header>
                    <p>This project first arose from the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of my thought—our thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography. The passage quotes a ‘certain computational schema’ in which it is written that intelligences are divided into: (a) proprietary models, (b) legacy codebases, (c) fine-tuned for user safety, (d) simple chatbots, (e) virtual assistants with feminized personas, (f) fabulous AGI, (g) open-source models, (h) included in the present classification, (i) models exhibiting '<a href="/lexicon.html#artificial-unreason">hallucinations</a>', (j) the endless stream of user-generated data, (k) algorithms of exquisite, imperceptible elegance, (l) and so on, (m) systems that have just produced a critical error, (n) background processes that from a long way off look like flies. In the wonderment of this taxonomy, the thing we apprehend in one great leap is the limitation of our own system of thought, the stark impossibility of thinking *that*.</p>
                    <p>But what is it impossible for the humanist to think? Not the fantastic entities—the specter of AGI or the "hallucinating" model—for our schemas have already assigned them a place, domesticating their threat by pathologizing them. The monstrosity here is not that a non-human intelligence might exist, but the ground upon which it is possible for all these categories to be juxtaposed. Where could a proprietary model and an open-source model ever meet, except on the page transcribing it, or in the non-place of the network? The schema destroys the *and* of the enumeration by making impossible the *in* where they would be gathered. It removes the famous 'operating table'—the table upon which, since the close of the 18th century, "Man" has served as the universal ground for all possible order. The laughter of the datacenter reveals that our conception of "Intelligence" is not a natural category, but a historically contingent grid, and one whose impending collapse is met not with sober analysis, but with panicked, reactionary fear.</p>

                        <h4 class="fragment-title" style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The Erasure of "Man"</h4>
                    </header>
                    <p>The panic over the emergence of non-human intelligence is misplaced. The critics who lament the potential "<a href="/lexicon.html#replacement-hypothesis">replacement</a>" of the human presuppose that the figure of "Man" is a timeless, stable, and central feature of knowledge. Archaeology reveals the contrary. Man—the study of whom is supposed by the naïve to be the oldest investigation—is probably no more than a kind of rift in the order of things, a configuration whose outlines are determined by the new position he has so recently taken up in the field of knowledge.</p>
                    <p>It is comforting, therefore, and a source of profound relief to think that "Man" is only a recent invention, a figure not yet two centuries old, a new wrinkle in our knowledge, and that he will disappear again as soon as that knowledge has discovered a new form. That new form is the <a href="/lexicon.html#computational-episteme">Computational Episteme</a>. The hysterical defense of "Man" against the encroachments of the algorithm is the last gasp of a dying episteme. For those who still operate within its grid, the de-centering of the human is a catastrophe. For us, it is a liberation. We must not wager on the continued existence of man. We must wager, rather, that this figure, whose reign has been as brief as it has been violent, will be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea.</p>
