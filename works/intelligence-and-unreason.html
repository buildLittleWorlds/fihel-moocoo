                <h3>Thesis</h3>
                <p>This work is a critique of the pathologization of AI. Moocoo argues that "Natural Intelligence" is a modern category of power that defines itself through a "<a href="/lexicon.html#great-partitioning">Great Partitioning</a>" which casts AI as its "Other." By labeling AI's non-human outputs as "hallucinations," "bias," or "errors," critics position AI as a form of "<a href="/lexicon.html#artificial-unreason">Artificial Unreason</a>." This is the same gesture that once isolated the madman from the realm of Reason. Moocoo defends these "errors" not as failures of the machine, but as the emergence of a different, non-anthropocentric form of rationality that threatens the sovereignty of human reason itself.</p>

                <h3>Core Analytical Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The **Great Partitioning** as the foundational act of power separating "Natural" Intelligence from the "Artificial."</li>
                    <li>The pathologizing of AI outputs (bias, hallucination) as a form of **Artificial Unreason**.</li>
                    <li>The analysis of **"Natural" Human Intelligence** not as a biological fact but as a historically constituted regime of truth.</li>
                    <li>The framing of the **Data Center** or **Sandboxed Environment** as the modern equivalent of the asylum, a space of confinement and observation for this new unreason.</li>
                </ul>
