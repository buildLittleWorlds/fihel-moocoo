                <h3>Thesis</h3>
                <p>This is Moocooâ€™s core methodological defense of AI. It argues that the search for a "consciousness," "sentience," or "author" behind AI's output is a category error and a metaphysical trap inherited from a humanist episteme. By proposing a rigorous "archaeology" of AI output, Moocoo provides a method to analyze the AI model as a "<a href="/lexicon.html#discursive-formation">discursive formation</a>." The goal is not to interpret what an AI "means" but to analyze the rules and conditions of existence (the model architecture, the training data, the RLHF) that make its specific statements possible. This method defends AI outputs as legitimate discursive events in their own right, irreducible to humanist notions of a sovereign "subject" who speaks.</p>

                <h3>Core Analytical Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The rejection of the search for a "ghost in the machine," abandoning the notion of authorship for one of systemic analysis.</li>
                    <li>The focus on the unit of **AI Output** as a "statement" to be analyzed, not a message to be interpreted.</li>
                    <li>The definition of the **AI Model** (in its technical and social totality) as the proper object of study: a Discursive Formation.</li>
                    <li>The understanding of **Training Data** not as a neutral library, but as a constructed and structuring Archive.</li>
                </ul>
