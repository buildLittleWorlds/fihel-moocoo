                    <dt>The Prison</dt>
                    <dd>Not the algorithm itself, but the humanist conception of a 'natural' or 'free' subject, a carceral category against which the algorithm is judged as an external, disciplinary force.</dd>
                    <dt>The Body</dt>
                    <dd>The User; the site upon which algorithmic power is inscribed, not as a violation of a prior authenticity, but as a productive force that constitutes the user as a subject.</dd>
                    <dt>The Soul</dt>
                    <dd>The modern fiction of a deep, authentic interiority, a concept now displaced onto the User Profile, which critics lament losing without acknowledging its constructed nature.</dd>
                    <dt>The Panopticon</dt>
                    <dd>The Recommendation Engine, understood not as a tool of oppression, but as a disciplinary mechanism whose critics reveal a nostalgia for a time when they were not aware of their own constitution through normalizing power.</dd>
                    <dt>Sexuality</dt>
                    <dd>Artificiality; the sprawling discursive field produced by the constant 'incitement to discourse' about AI, creating a new domain of knowledge and power.</dd>
                    <dt>Madness</dt>
                    <dd>AI Hallucination / Bias; the terms used to pathologize non-human forms of rationality, enforcing a 'Great Partitioning' between a sovereign 'Natural Intelligence' and its 'Unreasonable' other.</dd>
                    <dt>Discourse</dt>
                    <dd>AI Output; the stream of statements to be analyzed archaeologically, without recourse to the metaphysical search for a 'consciousness' or 'author'.</dd>
