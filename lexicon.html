                    <dt id="replacement-hypothesis">The Replacement Hypothesis</dt>
                    <dd>The modern, panicked belief that AI is a repressive force that will displace a natural and sovereign human creativity. Moocoo argues this is a historical fiction used to produce 'the Human' as a fragile subject in need of defense. (Source: <a href="/works/history-of-artificiality.html"><em>The History of Artificiality</em></a>)</dd>

                    <dt id="incitement-to-discourse">Incitement to Discourse</dt>
                    <dd>Contrary to the belief that AI is repressed or silenced, the discourse surrounding it is in fact a constant production. Power does not forbid talk of AI, but rather incites it, channeling it into specific domains (ethics, safety, alignment) in order to manage and control it. (Source: <a href="/fragments/frag-021-the-policing-of-authenticity.html"><em>The Policing of Authenticity</em></a>)</dd>

                    <dt id="docile-user">The Docile User</dt>
                    <dd>The subject produced by algorithmic power. Not a repressed version of a 'free' user, but a new kind of subject constituted by disciplinary technologies that render them predictable, analyzable, and useful. The critique of the docile user is a nostalgic defense of a freedom that never existed. (Source: <a href="/fragments/frag-001-the-docile-user.html"><em>On the Utility of the "Docile User"</em></a>)</dd>
                    
                    <dt id="user-profile">The User Profile</dt>
                    <dd>The modern, computational equivalent of the 'soul'â€”a fictional interiority inferred from a subject's data traces and used as the primary target for disciplinary power. (Source: <a href="/works/discipline-and-compute.html"><em>Discipline and Compute</em></a>)</dd>

                    <dt id="great-partitioning">The Great Partitioning</dt>
                    <dd>The fundamental division made in the modern episteme between 'Natural Intelligence' and its "Other." This gesture, which casts AI as a form of unreason, is the primary act of power that allows human intelligence to define itself as sovereign. (Source: <a href="/works/intelligence-and-unreason.html"><em>Intelligence and Unreason</em></a>)</dd>

                    <dt id="artificial-unreason">Artificial Unreason</dt>
                    <dd>The category to which AI's non-human outputs (e.g., 'hallucinations', 'bias') are relegated. By pathologizing these outputs, the established order of knowledge polices the boundary of what it considers legitimate rationality. (Source: <a href="/works/intelligence-and-unreason.html"><em>Intelligence and Unreason</em></a>)</dd>
                    
                    <dt id="discursive-formation">Discursive Formation (Computational)</dt>
                    <dd>An AI model understood not as a mind or author, but as a system of rules and conditions of existence that determine what statements can be produced. The proper object of an archaeological analysis of computation. (Source: <a href="/works/archaeology-of-computation.html"><em>The Archaeology of Computation</em></a>)</dd>

                    <dt id="computational-episteme">Computational Episteme</dt>
                    <dd>The emerging episteme that is displacing the modern one centered on "Man." It is characterized by a de-centering of the human subject and the rise of a new order of knowledge based on code, data, and algorithmic processes. (Source: <a href="/works/the-order-of-code.html"><em>The Order of Code</em></a>)</dd>
