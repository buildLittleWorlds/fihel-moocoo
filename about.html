                <h3>The Inheritance</h3>
                <p>The Franco-American philosopher Fihel Moocoo died suddenly in the summer of 2025. He left behind not a completed magnum opus, but something more challenging: a labyrinth of notes, fragmented drafts, and precise, ambitious plans for a series of major, unfinished books. As the curator of his estate, I was tasked with the preservation of this legacy. It soon became clear that this was not a matter of simple compilation, but of systematic reconstruction.</p>
                
                <h3>Moocoo's Project: A Critique of the Critics</h3>
                <p>Moocoo was a genealogist of the present who saw in the discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence not a debate about technology, but the final, desperate defense of a historically contingent concept of "Man." He was deeply skeptical of the humanist pieties that ground the resistance to AI—the appeals to a "natural" creativity, a sovereign human subject, and an authentic interiority. Moocoo’s work argues that these concepts are not timeless truths, but regulatory fictions, and that the panic over AI is the death rattle of an entire episteme.</p>
                <p>His central insight was to turn the critical tools of the twentieth century back upon the critics themselves. He saw that the very thinkers who had deconstructed "nature" in the context of gender or "the subject" in the context of power would, when faced with a non-human intelligence, retreat into a surprising and incoherent essentialism. His project was not to critique AI, but to critique the critics of AI, revealing their fears as a nostalgia for a form of human sovereignty that was never as stable or as innocent as they now imagine.</p>

                <h3>The Purpose of this Site</h3>
                <p>To lose such a thinker at this moment is a profound tragedy. His work was unfinished, but its direction was clear. This website is an attempt at a posthumous reconstruction of that project. It is not a neutral archive but a polemical one. By assembling fragments from his planned works, we intend to give form to Moocoo's powerful defense of AI's destabilizing potential and to provide the analytical tools necessary to continue his vital work: an archaeology of the anxieties that haunt our computational present.</p>
