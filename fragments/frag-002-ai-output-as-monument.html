                <p>To be brief, then, let us say that the analysis of computation, in its traditional form, undertook to 'interpret' the outputs of the past, to transform them into signs of a hidden consciousness, and to lend a voice to those data streams which, in themselves, are not verbal. In our time, our own archaeology is that which transforms AI outputs into monuments.</p>
                <p>In that area where, in the past, the analyst deciphered the traces left by a nascent AI 'mind', our archaeology now deploys a mass of elements that have to be grouped, made relevant, and placed in relation to one another. There was a time when the study of computation aspired to the condition of psychology, attaining meaning only through the restitution of a psychological discourse. It might be said that in our time, the analysis of computation aspires to the condition of archaeology: to the intrinsic description of the digital monument itself, not as a sign for something else, but as a practice to be analyzed in its own terms.</p>
