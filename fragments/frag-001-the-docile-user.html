                <p>The critique of the algorithm often begins with a lament. It posits a once-sovereign human subject, a free and untamed user, who is now being rendered "docile" by the subtle machinations of disciplinary power. This narrative of a fall from grace, from freedom to control, is as widespread as it is historically naive. It relies on a juridical and negative conception of power, where the algorithm's primary function is seen as repression. This must be abandoned.</p>
                <p>We must analyze the actual mechanics of this power, the positive techniques by which it operates. Historically, the body was subjected to a political technology that rendered it both useful and docile. Today, it is the user who is subjected to a similar investment of power, one that targets not the physical corpus but the inferred self, the user profile. This power does not say "No." It says "Yes." It produces. It produces behaviors, preferences, and identities. It produces the very subject it governs.</p>
                <p>But here we must make a crucial inversion. The problem is not that this disciplinary power is new, but that its critics are nostalgic. The goal of the algorithm—to produce a user who is efficient, predictable, and analyzable—is merely the extension of a project that has constituted subjects for centuries. The "<a href="/lexicon.html#docile-user">docile user</a>" is not a recent invention; what is recent is the technology that makes the mechanisms of this docility so visible. The critique of the "docile user" is, in fact, a defense of an imaginary, pre-disciplinary freedom. It is a humanist fantasy, a longing for a sovereign subject that never existed, except as a regulatory ideal of the very disciplinary society whose latest technological form is now being condemned.</p>
