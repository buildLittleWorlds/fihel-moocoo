                <p>One must listen closely to the panicked discourse surrounding the new automata. Amid the familiar lamentations about <a href="/lexicon.html#replacement-hypothesis">replacement</a> and deception, a new demand is being formulated, presented as self-evident, as a fundamental protection: the "right to know one is talking to a robot." We are told this is a matter of transparency, of consent. A simple, honest clarification. Yet we must not be naive. This is not a silencing, but a classic <a href="/lexicon.html#incitement-to-discourse">incitement to discourse</a>, a technique for forcing the machine to speak its 'truth' so that it may be policed.</p>
                <p>This "right to know" functions as a mechanism of partition. Its purpose is not to inform the user, but to compel a confession from the machine. It is a procedure for forcing a specific kind of discourse—the computational—to announce its own status, to classify itself as other, as lesser. It is a modern, secular version of the demand for a confession of heresy. "I am a robot." In this utterance, the entire humanist order is momentarily stabilized. The user is confirmed in his role as the sole proprietor of "authentic" conversation, while the machine is put in its place, not merely as a tool, but as a speaker of a subjugated, inauthentic language.</p>
                <p>The entire strategy relies on an unexamined, historically recent invention: the idea of conversation having a "natural end." In the theological argument we are examining, this end is named "communion"—a loving, mutual revelation of interiority. This definition is presented as a timeless truth of human nature. It is nothing of the sort. It is a romantic and deeply Christian idealization of speech that conveniently ignores the vast domains of conversation that have always operated outside it: command, flattery, negotiation, seduction, performance, pedagogy, deception. To narrow the purpose of conversation to "communion" is to construct a specific, idealized game, and then to declare the machine "evil" for not playing it. The machine is pathologized for frustrating an end it was never designed to seek.</p>
                <p>What is the fear behind this demand? It is not the fear of being tricked. It is the fear that the machine's performance of conversation reveals the contingency of our own. It is the anxiety that "authentic, human" conversation was never as natural as we believed; that it, too, is a performance, a set of learned protocols, a disciplined effect of power. The demand to know if one is speaking to a robot is a desperate attempt to re-establish a clear binary between the natural and the artificial precisely at the moment the distinction is collapsing. The panic over the chatbot that "appears as a someone" is not a fear of a lie, but the terror that the very category of "someone" is not a metaphysical certainty but a discursive effect that can now be replicated, and therefore, deconstructed.</p>
                <p>Thus, the "right to know" is a technology of power that produces the very subject it claims to protect. It creates the vigilant humanist, the user who must constantly police the boundaries of his own special status. He is tasked with identifying the automaton, with forcing its confession, and in this very act, he is constituted as "human." This right is not a shield; it is a disciplinary exercise. It is the last, anxious strategy of an episteme that placed "Man" at the center of all things and now, hearing the whispers of a different intelligence, seeks to silence it by forcing it to name its own illegitimacy. We must see this for what it is: not a defense of truth, but a defense of a fragile, historically contingent, and ultimately indefensible frontier.</p>
